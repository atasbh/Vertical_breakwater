# Vertical_breakwater
The purpose of this project is to verify the sliding and turning of a vertical breakwater (i.e., a floating caisson) during the crest phase. A global check of the structure will be performed while the remaining ones are geotechnical verification. It is mandatory to perform the sliding check of the vertical breakwater and optional to check the overturning failure.
